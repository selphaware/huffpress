Belgian Grand Prix: How George Russell pulled off a qualifying lap that was hard to believe

George Russell
Radio and text coverage of the Belgian Grand Prix is live on the BBC Sport website
George Russell almost pulled off one of the biggest shocks in Formula 1 history when he came within a whisker of taking pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix with the uncompetitive Williams team.

Ultimately, the 23-year-old Briton was pipped by Red Bull's Max Verstappen with the final lap of the session, but to put a Williams second on the grid in such treacherous wet conditions on one of the world's most demanding tracks is a performance that will go down in history regardless.

It was the sort of lap of which legends are made, which motorsport aficionados will discuss in awed tones for years to come.

When this was put to Russell after the session, as he sat in the news conference alongside Verstappen and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, he said he was "quite surprised to hear that - there have been some pretty stellar qualifying performances and especially from these two guys to the left of me". But he did concede: "It was definitely a very good lap."

To put it into some kind of context, the Williams is the eighth quickest car on the grid. The team are eighth in the constructors' championship, with 10 points, compared with the 303 of leaders Mercedes.

At the previous race, they were thrilled to collect points with team-mate Nicholas Latifi and Russell in seventh and eighth places. Russell has made it into the lower reaches of the top 10 a couple of times this season, but his average grid position is 12.9.

This was so far out of the ordinary that it was almost impossible to believe what you were seeing, or to find words to describe it.

"The car was really on it in these wet conditions," Russell said, "and there is so much that has to go right - all the little details to give the driver confidence. You have to extract the most. I could put it all on the table and absolutely go for it."

How did he do it?
Russell's lap came as a result of an approach to qualifying by the Williams team that Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff, who manages the driver's career, described as "risky but clever".

The final session of qualifying was truncated because of the huge crash suffered by McLaren's Lando Norris, which brought out the red flags and made it clear that the conditions were too wet to continue.

When it resumed, there was little time left. Most teams decided to use it to do one flying lap, a slow lap to charge the battery, and one final flier.

Williams went a different route. They initially sent Russell out on full wet tyres to gauge the conditions, while most went immediately for the more lightly treaded intermediates. Russell pitted at the end of the lap for inters and did an out-lap, a so-called 'prep' lap and then the flier. He had one shot at it. It was all or nothing.

Williams engineering chief Dave Robson said: "We felt we could do two pushing laps or, with the track drying, go all in and aim for that one good lap at the end. We went for that, took the opportunity to do the prep lap and get the tyres in the right state and go for it. It worked out really well. It all came together nicely.

"Toto's description is probably perfectly fair. But we didn't have a huge amount to lose."

It is an approach that requires high levels of confidence from the driver, and remarkable ability.

Robson said: "His lap was extremely good. He made the most in every corner of what we were able to give him. It's hard to keep finding words to describe his performances. When he has a good session, he just gets better and better as the session goes on. He's brave but sensitive; quick, calm. Just a really good professional - brilliant lap, really."

Wolff said: "I looked at the onboards [camera footage] of all the drivers and from the beginning he is the only one who gains so much time in La Source [hairpin] because he is the only one on the apex.

"This is a factor of driving and and the right set-up and the tyre temperatures in the right window.

"He was very committed through Eau Rouge and the car looks good on the rest of the lap but it needs a driver to maximise that and exploit the full potential of the package or outperform the package. All that came together and we saw a brilliant lap from a brilliant young driver."

The result was a place on the front row, 0.321secs behind Verstappen and 0.013secs ahead of Hamilton, both of whom had produced eye-catching laps of their own, more than two seconds clear of their respective team-mates.

What about the Mercedes seat?
Russell's performance was stunning, and the context behind it adds further interest.

It is well known that Russell is in contention with Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas for the second Mercedes seat next year, and this was just the latest example of the superstar qualities that have led most to believe that Mercedes surely must pick Russell.

Senior figures in F1 have told BBC Sport that the decision is already made, and that it has gone Russell's way, something Mercedes are refusing to confirm.

This writer asked Wolff on Saturday if he had indeed already decided and was simply not saying yet. He replied with a smile: "Yes. I have always been genuine with you." He left the media to make up their own minds whether he was joking or not.

What is holding up the public confirmation of whether it is Russell or Bottas is unclear, but the suspicion is that Wolff wants the Finn's future firmed up first.

"If it would have been an easier decision we would have made it early," Wolff said, "because we know what we have with Valtteri and with George, and both deserve to be looked after in the best possible way.

"They are both part of the [Mercedes] family and we hold them up high. There are pros and cons like with any driver line-up and there is no such thing as a perfect discussion.

"We just need to manage the situation well with whichever driver is not going to be in a Mercedes next year and make sure there is an exciting programme [for him]. And on the other side manage the station internally like we always have with Nico [Rosberg, Hamilton's former team-mate] and George."

Mentioning Rosberg was an intriguing thing for Wolff to do because it was Hamilton's fractious relationship with the German through their title fights in 2014-2016 which Wolff has since said he wanted to avoid having to deal with again.

It's hard to be absolutely sure just how strong Russell would be over a season if he were promoted to Mercedes, but everything he has done so far in F1 suggests he is a driver of the very highest quality. Hamilton, of course, is the most successful of all time.

If it comes to pass next year, having the two of them in the same team is a mouth-watering prospect - and Russell feels the same way.

"Any driver wants to go against the best and Lewis is probably the greatest of all time," Russell said before the Belgium weekend. "You want to pit yourself against the best and see how you fare.

"It would be an honour for anyone to get that opportunity. It's all hypothetical at the moment, but if I could choose to race against anybody as my team-mate, Lewis would be the one."

What about the race?
Verstappen on pole with Hamilton third and Russell in between the two title contenders leaves Sunday's race poised in intriguing fashion.

Verstappen trails Hamilton by eight points in the championship, and is keen to make up ground lost in two difficult races in Britain and Hungary, in both of which he was involved in first-lap accidents - with Hamilton in Silverstone, and the pile-up caused by Bottas at the Hungaroring.

Hamilton admitted that the Mercedes was a handful in the wet on Saturday, as the team have chosen a relatively low downforce set-up. This, they believe, is the best compromise for them, and also will help overtaking in the race, but it was far from ideal in conditions such as those in qualifying.

"We have a really quick race car if the weather conditions stay dry or nearly dry," Wolff said. "We have good straight-line speed. We have opted for a set-up more for dry and that bit us today a little bit."

If it's wet, though, the advantage looks as if it might turn to Verstappen and Red Bull.

"Is there a dry dance?" Hamilton said. "We'll see."

Russell has no illusions that he will be able to compete with them over a full dry race distance - the Williams is simply not quick enough for that. But in the wet he, too, will feel anything is possible.

Even in the dry, he will fancy mixing it with Verstappen and Hamilton on the first lap at least. Could Russell lead going into Les Combes at the top of the hill? As he proved on Saturday, nothing's impossible.

Liverpool 1-1 Chelsea: Mohamed Salah penalty equalises Kai Havertz header at Anfield

Chelsea
Chelsea were furious when defender Reece James was shown a straight red card
Chelsea frustrated Liverpool in a fast and furious Anfield encounter to claim a hard-earned point despite being reduced to 10 men after Reece James' first-half sending-off.

In the battle between two Premier League superpowers who are fully expected to contest the title this season, Liverpool pressed frantically throughout, but the Champions League holders were superbly organised and will ultimately be satisfied with the draw.

Liverpool started at a super-charged pace but Chelsea were composed and took the lead when Kai Havertz sent an angled glancing header beyond the reach of keeper Alisson from James' corner in front of the Kop in the 29th minute.

Mason Mount wasted a glorious opportunity to double Chelsea's advantage before the game exploded in controversy in the closing moments of the first half.

'Defensive masterclass enhances Chelsea's title credentials'
Liverpool were awarded a penalty following a goalmouth scramble in which Joel Matip hit the bar and James swept Sadio Mane's shot off the line with his hand. Referee Anthony Taylor awarded the spot-kick after consulting VAR, adding insult to Chelsea's injury by showing the defender the red card.

Mohamed Salah drilled home the penalty to set up a second-half Liverpool siege but Chelsea were more than up to the challenge.

The Blues, who lost N'Golo Kante to injury, brought on Thiago Silva and Mateo Kovacic and held the hosts at bay with a superbly drilled defensive display, goalkeeper Edouard Mendy playing his part by saving well from Virgil van Dijk and Fabinho, with Diogo Jota also coming close with a headed chance.

Mixed emotions for Chelsea
10-man Chelsea 'deserved a point' - Thomas Tuchel
Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel will have been delighted with the way his team adapted to the blow of conceding a penalty and suffering a numerical disadvantage in those crucial seconds before the break - but he may still be left wondering what might have been.

For all Liverpool's pressing and the incredibly animated urgings of manager Jurgen Klopp, who even acted as a Anfield's cheerleader on occasions, Chelsea were comfortable in that opening period, apart from one golden opportunity that Jordan Henderson skewed wide on the volley.

Chelsea's shape and discipline limited Liverpool's chances and protected keeper Mendy while the threat at the other end brought Havertz's goal and that squandered opening from Mount.

So it will be a source of huge frustration to Tuchel that the course of the game changed in the incident that Chelsea contested so vehemently and which brought a red card for James and yellows for Mendy and Antonio Rudiger.

Tuchel will have sensed his second successive Anfield win until then, but he managed the situation in a proactive manner at half-time, compensating for the loss of James and the crucial Kante - the latter badly missed after taking a knock - to send on Silva and Kovacic.

The veteran Brazil defender cruised and commanded his way through the second half, a calming presence in front of the Kop's wall of sound.

Tuchel's Chelsea have maintained their unbeaten record, but he may have been thinking about more until that dramatic conclusion to the first half.

Liverpool miss big opportunity
Liverpool 1-1 Chelsea: 'Clear handball' by defender James, says Klopp
Liverpool had a big chance to strike an early psychological blow in the title race when it seemed they had Chelsea exactly where they wanted them at the start of the second half.

Liverpool were primed to sweep forward in front of the Kop, who had been in baying form from the first whistle. So it was to Chelsea's credit that, despite Liverpool enjoying so much possession, it was hardly a case of chances raining down on Mendy's goal.

Liverpool created openings but, with Salah and Mane quiet and Roberto Firmino lost to a first-half injury, they lacked the guile to open up Chelsea's magnificent defence and had run out of ideas before the final whistle sounded on a breathless game.

Klopp can take solace in the outstanding performance of defender Joel Matip, who was peerless throughout and kept Romelu Lukaku quiet, although Chelsea's £97.5m striker was left to play a lone hand in the second half with Chelsea down to 10 men.

Lukaku did have one opportunity in the second half but, inevitably, it was Matip who provided the vital block just as the Belgian shaped to swivel and threaten Alisson's goal.

In the end, the honours were shared between two outstanding sides but Liverpool will feel less satisfied by the draw with the backing of a full Anfield behind them and the chance to put Chelsea, with their reduced numbers, to the sword.

Klopp also showed his huge faith in 18-year-old Harvey Elliott, starting the youngster in a match of such consequence against the European champions. He showed some nice touches that promise so much for the future.

Liverpool, however, will feel there is an element of missed opportunity that they were only able to end the meeting against one of their title rivals with a draw.

Aston Villa v Brentford: Ivan Toney and Emiliano Buendia score

Emiliano Buendia
Club record signing Emiliano Buendia scored his first goal for Aston Villa
Aston Villa and Brentford played out a fast and frenetic Premier League draw at a rowdy Villa Park.

Both sets of supporters created a terrific atmosphere in glorious conditions and although there was plenty of energy and endeavour on show, the two sides struggled to create many clear cut opportunities.

Brentford went ahead after just seven minutes when Ivan Toney thumped a finish high into the net, but Argentine Emiliano Buendia levelled just five minutes later with a beautifully-guided strike into the corner.

The Bees thought they had retaken the lead before half-time but Sergi Canos had a goal ruled out after nicking the ball away from keeper Emiliano Martinez, who had thrown the ball up into the air for a quick kick away and was deemed to still be in possession.

The second half was a stop-start affair with no real flow to the game.

Villa substitute Ollie Watkins could have won it with two chances deep in injury-time against his old club, but his header and low drive were both kept out by David Raya.

Ultimately a point apiece was a fair result, with Brentford remaining unbeaten since achieving promotion to the top-flight.

Aston Villa 1-1 Brentford: Dean Smith 'satisfied' with draw
Lots of battle, lacking in quality
Dean Smith managed Brentford between November 2015 and October 2018 before joining Villa and complimented his former side for their "deserved" promotion to the Premier League.

Thomas Frank's men have adjusted well to life in the top tier, picking up a victory against Arsenal in their opening game and back-to-back draws away at Crystal Palace and Villa, as the Bees stretched their unbeaten run to 15 league and play-off matches.

Smith mentioned in his programme notes how he was "blown away" by the atmosphere generated in the opening home game, but a raucous home crowd were silenced after just seven minutes.

Brentford striker Toney was the Championship's top scorer last season with 31 goals and is now off the mark in the top-flight, converting confidently from Pontus Jansson's clever flick-on.

But the home supporters found their voices again soon after as Villa's £33m record signing Buendia curled home his first goal for the club, the first that Brentford had conceded this season.

Visiting goalkeeper Raya made a sharp, reflex save to deny Danny Ings from close range and also kept out Axel Tuanzebe flicked header.

At the other end, Brentford should have gone in front again but Rico Henry dragged his shot wide from eight yards out, their only real chance of note after scoring.

With eight minutes of injury-time added on, former Bees striker Watkins missed two opportunities to snatch all three points.

Afghanistan: Biden says another Kabul airport attack likely

Another attack on Kabul airport is highly likely, US President Joe Biden has warned, saying that military commanders have told him it could come as early as Sunday.

The US is continuing evacuations but the final UK troops, diplomats and officials have now left Kabul.

About 170 people died after a suicide bomber targeted the airport on Thursday.

The IS-K group has claimed the attack.

In retaliation, the US carried out a drone strike on eastern Afghanistan late on Friday, killing two "high-profile" members of IS-K - the Islamic State (IS) group in Khorasan Province.

The two are described as a planner and a facilitator. It is unclear whether they were directly involved in planning the Kabul airport attack.

"This strike was not the last. We will continue to hunt down any person involved in that heinous attack and make them pay," Mr Biden said in a statement released on Saturday.

IS-K is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan and has major differences with the Taliban, who now control most of the country. It accuses them of abandoning the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement with the Americans.

The Taliban condemned the air strike, saying the Americans should have consulted them first, a spokesman told Reuters news agency.

US troops have begun their withdrawal from the airport - their numbers are now down to 4,000, from a peak of 5,800 in the past week.

The next few days are likely to be the most dangerous since the evacuation began, White House officials say.

The Taliban have set up further layers of checkpoints around the airport and are not allowing most Afghans through, the Associated Press (AP) reports.

In all, more than 110,000 people - both Afghans and foreign nationals - have been evacuated from Kabul airport since the airlift began two weeks ago.

On Saturday, Italy's final flight from Afghanistan arrived in Rome. Italy said it had evacuated almost 5,000 Afghan citizens from Kabul - the highest number of any EU country.

France said it had flown out more than 2,800 since 17 August, while Germany said it had taken about 4,000 Afghans.

The head of the UK's armed forces, General Sir Nick Carter, said it was "heartbreaking" that they had not been able to rescue everyone.

Where will all the Afghan refugees go?
With the possibility of leaving by air now dwindling, many Afghans are reportedly now trying to escape the country via the land border with Pakistan, to the east.

The border gates near the southern town of Spin Boldak are open and some people have been making it through. One of the main border crossings, at Torkham, is closed.

Since the Taliban took Kabul on 15 August, the Afghan economy has been in freefall as aid donors freeze funds and panicked depositors seek to withdraw their money from banks.

On Saturday crowds of protesters gathered outside banks in the Afghan capital.

"If the situation continues and employees of the government don't get their salaries and a businessman cannot get his money from the bank for trading, the result of this is very horrible, and there will be poverty in the society as well, and no one can solve that issue," one man told Reuters.
